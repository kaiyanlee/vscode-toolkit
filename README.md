<p><img width="100%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kaiyanlee/vscode-toolkit/master/assets/banner.png"></p>

This extension will bundle several useful scripts to improve my developer productivity. It is mainly supposed to be used for my own personal editing needs so I have decided not to publish it on any marketplace.

## Getting Started

```
git clone https://github.com/kaiyanlee/vscode-toolkit
cd vscode-toolkit && code .
```

## Package

Execute `vsce package` and then install the `.vsix` file manually from inside the application.

## Features

These features should all work with multiple selections.

### Insert Sequence

### Insert Date and Time

Select a date format and insert the current date and time.

### Encode Base64 (UTF-8)

Select text and Base64 encode it.

### Decode Base64 (UTF-8)

Select text and Base64 decode it.
